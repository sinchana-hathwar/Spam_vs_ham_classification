Learn Software Architecture with Python [free 5-hour coding course],"Here are this week's five links that are worth your time: 1. freeCodeCamp just published a hands-on Microservice Architecture course. This is a great way to learn about Distributed Systems. You can code along at home, and build your own video-to-MP3 file converter app. Along the way, you'll learn some MongoDB, Kubernetes, and MySQL. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/microservices-and-software-system-design-course/ 2. TypeScript is like JavaScript, but with static types. For each variable, you specify whether it's a string, integer, boolean, or other data type. If you already know some JavaScript, TypeScript may not take that much time to learn. And it can reduce the number of bugs in your code. freeCodeCamp has converted almost our entire codebase to use TypeScript. It still has all the power of JavaScript, but it's now a bit easier for us to build new features. This beginner course will teach you everything you need to get started coding TypeScript. (5 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/programming-in-typescript/ 3. Testing is a vital part of the software development process. You want to ensure that all your app's features work as intended. Thankfully, there are some powerful tools out there to help you write robust tests. This handbook will teach you how to code the most fundamental type of test: unit tests. It will also show you some web development best practices for using Jest and the React Testing Library. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-unit-tests-in-react-redux/ 4. Learn CSS and Responsive Web Design for beginners. Jessica's new guide will walk you through one of freeCodeCamp's most popular projects: coding your own cafÃ© menu. She'll show you how to build it step-by-step. You can do this entire project on freeCodeCamp's core curriculum interactively, and reference Jessica's article when you get stuck or just need additional context. (45 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css/ 5. Also, freeCodeCamp just published a massive Bootstrap course in Spanish, where you'll code your own portfolio. (We've also published several Bootstrap courses in English, too). If you have Spanish-speaking friends who want to learn web development and design, please tell them that we now have in-depth courses on a broad range of coding topics. These are all taught in Spanish by Estefania. She's an experienced teacher and software engineer.

Learn Python Programming [free coding book for beginners],"Here are this week's five links that are worth your time: 1. Python is one of the most widely used programming languages on Earth right now. In science, in industry, and in high school robotics clubs around the world. You, too, can learn to wield this mighty Python power. I'm sick as a dog as I type this, so if what I'm saying sounds silly, it's probably the NyQuil talking. freeCodeCamp has published dozens of Python video courses, but this week I wanted to share something for the folks who prefer good old fashion book learning. (full-length book): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-book/ 2. Ah. Graph Algorithms. The bane of every coding interview prepper. These powerful programming patterns are over-represented in job interview questions, so you'll want to eventually learn them well. This course will help you grok Depth-First Traversal, Breadth-First Traversal, Shortest Path, and Dijkstra's Algorithm. This Dijkstra guy, he's kind of a big deal. More on him later. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-how-graph-algorithms-work/ 3. User Interface VS User Experience â what's the difference, you might ask? Well, User Interfaces have been around since the industrial revolution. Think the control room of a power station, or the cockpit of a plane. But User Experience â that's a more recent way of thinking about Human-Computer Interaction. The term was coined in the 1990s by a designer and cognitive psychologist at Apple. This tutorial by freeCodeCamp instructor Dionysia Lemonaki will explain the distinctions between the two and their shared history. She'll also walk you through the UX Design Process. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ux-vs-ui-whats-the-difference-definition-and-meaning/ 4. Without computer networks, I'd need to put on my sneakers and run this letter to your door. Or bankrupt our charity buying postage stamps. Over the past 30 years, networks have changed almost everything about talking, learning, and getting things done. They are worthy of your attention and your respect. So learn a bit more about how they work. This tutorial will walk you through 5 of the most important layers â from the physical hardware all the way up to the applications running on top of all that sweet, sweet abstraction. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-five-layers-model-explained/ 5. The freeCodeCamp community just turned 8 years old. A big Happy Birthday to all y'all who've been a part of our charity's endeavor. I have a byte-sized update on the community (8.9Kb of text, to be exact).

Learn Data Science with Python [free 26-hour Course on PyTorch Machine Learning],"Here are this week's five links that are worth your time: 1. Pytorch is a popular framework for doing Machine Learning in Python. You can use it to build data models, then ask questions of those models. If you're interested in Data Science, and know a bit of Python, this course is a solid place to start your journey. You'll code along at home as you learn about Datasets, Neural Networks, Computer Vision, and more. (26 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-pytorch-for-deep-learning-in-day/ 2. And if you're new to Python programming, this course focuses on core concepts rather than just the language syntax. You'll explore Computer Science concepts like Primitive Data Types, Memory Allocation, Error Handling, and Scope. (9 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-by-thinking-in-types/ 3. Linux is a popular operating system for Security Researchers. It's open source and highly customizable. This tutorial will walk you through how some popular distros â like Kali, Arch, and Ubuntu â work under the hood. You'll get a feel for their many moving parts, and the common shell commands used in infosec. (30 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/linux-basics/ 4. And if you have always wanted to learn some Java, you're in luck. We just published a Java for Beginners course, taught by Java Engineer and prolific freeCodeCamp instructor Farhan Chowdhury. You'll learn all about Java's Data Types, Operators, Conditional Statements, Loops, and even some Object-Oriented Programming. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-java-programming/ 5. One of the most powerful concepts in CSS is Selectors. You can use Selectors to grab an HTML element from a website's DOM. You can then style these elements, or run JavaScript on them. This tutorial will teach you all about Attribute Selectors, CSS Combinators, Pseudo-Element Selectors, and more. (30 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-selectors-cheat-sheet-for-beginners/ The freeCodeCamp community is doing everything in our power to create new learning resources like these each week.

Call for Papers: Special Issue on Non-probabilistic and Hybrid Approaches for Uncertainty Quantification and Reliability Analysis,"ASME Journal of Mechanical Design: Special Issue Call-for-Papers: 'Data-Driven Design (D3)' ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Eng. Systems Connect with us: ASME's Guide for Journal Authors Submit Your Manuscript â†’ CALL FOR PAPERS ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems, Part B: Mechanical Engineering Special Issue on Non-probabilistic and Hybrid Approaches for Uncertainty Quantification and Reliability Analysis (SI042B) Computational models have played a crucial role in the transition from a traditional experiment-centered engineering practice towards a virtual design context, where the performance of designed components is assessed long before the first prototype is built. Recent advances in numerical approaches enable in this context the application of hyper-resolution, high-fidelity, and first principle-based computer simulations which provide an analyst with a plethora of information on the design at hand. However, in most realistic engineering cases, the designer is faced with a multitude of sources of uncertainty on both the actual model form (i.e., the equations that have to be solved) and on the physical quantities that are used to parametrize these models. Such uncertainty stems either from the apparently pure random nature of some physical quantities (e.g., earthquake or wind loadings on a structure, or the mechanical behavior of complex materials such as soil or parts produced with Additive Manufacturing), incomplete knowledge on the actual value of these quantities (e.g., stemming from incomplete or too scarce data or future design decisions that yet have to be made), or a combination of both. When uncertainty stemming from incomplete knowledge is involved in the design process, non-probabilistic and hybrid/polymorphic approaches are gaining momentum for the assessment of the (bounds on the) reliability of designed structures and components, and the quantification of the underlying model response uncertainty. In this context, powerful techniques based on e.g., the framework of interval or fuzzy calculus, p-box formulations, information theory, Dempster-Shafer belief functions or game theoretical foundations, have been introduced in the last two decades. However, their application towards realistic engineering applications requires further developments both on a theoretical as well as a numerical/algorithmic level. Scope This Special Issue is aimed at gathering contributions that discuss new theoretical developments and advanced applications of non-probabilistic and hybrid approaches towards uncertainty quantification and reliability analysis. More specifically, papers discussing theoretical developments in the framework of non-probabilistic, hybrid, or polymorphic uncertainty and efficient numerical (or semi-) analytical propagation schemes for forward and inverse analysis with such uncertainty models are of particular interest for this Special Issue. In view of assisting the translation of these novel methods towards application, papers that apply these methods to challenging and realistic engineering cases in general are also welcomed, especially if the non-probabilistic or hybrid models for the uncertainty are based on real data. Indicative Topics: â€¢ New theoretical developments in the modeling of, and simulation with non-probabilistic or hybrid representations of uncertainty such as intervals, fuzzy sets, set-valued approaches, interval probabilities, credal sets, Dempster-Shafer belief functions, interval fields, or imprecise random fields. â€¢ Efficient propagation schemes for such non-probabilistic or hybrid representations, including new algorithmic developments, surrogate models, model order reduction, or low-rank representations.

3D Printing in Combat Areas and Space,"ASME TechReboot - ME Magazine Newsletter Oil Industries Crucial Partner for Climate Change 02.06.2020 Top 10 Bioengineering Trends Personalized medicine, miniaturization, material innovations, and additive manufacturing are key engineering trends that bioengineers are eager to incorporate into their designs. Here are the ten top trends for bioengineering R&D in 2020. 3D Printing in Hostile Environments The Fabrication in Austere Environments pilot program deployed a ruggerized 3D printer to an undisclosed desert locale to demonstrate that troops without engineering or medical degrees can easily and quickly 3D print all the necessary supplies and tools as they need them. In parallel to the military deployment, a similar experiment has been successfully conducted in another remote locationâ€”aboard the International Space Station. Energy Blog: The Oil Industry is Part of the Solution The quickest way to tackle climate change is to enlist the oil and gas industry as a critical partner. Petroleum companies have some of the deepest pockets and most technically capable workforces around. How are Mechanical Engineers and Canned Pineapples Related? Commercial pineapple production started about 1890. How were pineapples processed in that era? Pineapples were peeled and cut by hand to fit into standard size cans. Blades attached to steam-powered wheels whittled the pineapples to size. Large pineapples were forced into smaller diameter cans, with the outer portions thrown out as waste. The fruit was soaked in a lye solution until its tough outer skin fell off.

Call for Papers: Special Issue on Non-probabilistic and Hybrid Approaches for Uncertainty Quantification and Reliability Analysis,"ASME Journal of Mechanical Design: Special Issue Call-for-Papers: 'Data-Driven Design (D3)' ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Eng. Systems Connect with us: ASME's Guide for Journal Authors Submit Your Manuscript â†’ CALL FOR PAPERS ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems, Part B: Mechanical Engineering Special Issue on Non-probabilistic and Hybrid Approaches for Uncertainty Quantification and Reliability Analysis (SI042B) Computational models have played a crucial role in the transition from a traditional experiment-centered engineering practice towards a virtual design context, where the performance of designed components is assessed long before the first prototype is built. Recent advances in numerical approaches enable in this context the application of hyper-resolution, high-fidelity, and first principle-based computer simulations which provide an analyst with a plethora of information on the design at hand. However, in most realistic engineering cases, the designer is faced with a multitude of sources of uncertainty on both the actual model form (i.e., the equations that have to be solved) and on the physical quantities that are used to parametrize these models. Such uncertainty stems either from the apparently pure random nature of some physical quantities (e.g., earthquake or wind loadings on a structure, or the mechanical behavior of complex materials such as soil or parts produced with Additive Manufacturing), incomplete knowledge on the actual value of these quantities (e.g., stemming from incomplete or too scarce data or future design decisions that yet have to be made), or a combination of both. When uncertainty stemming from incomplete knowledge is involved in the design process, non-probabilistic and hybrid/polymorphic approaches are gaining momentum for the assessment of the (bounds on the) reliability of designed structures and components, and the quantification of the underlying model response uncertainty. In this context, powerful techniques based on e.g., the framework of interval or fuzzy calculus, p-box formulations, information theory, Dempster-Shafer belief functions or game theoretical foundations, have been introduced in the last two decades. However, their application towards realistic engineering applications requires further developments both on a theoretical as well as a numerical/algorithmic level. Scope This Special Issue is aimed at gathering contributions that discuss new theoretical developments and advanced applications of non-probabilistic and hybrid approaches towards uncertainty quantification and reliability analysis. More specifically, papers discussing theoretical developments in the framework of non-probabilistic, hybrid, or polymorphic uncertainty and efficient numerical (or semi-) analytical propagation schemes for forward and inverse analysis with such uncertainty models are of particular interest for this Special Issue. In view of assisting the translation of these novel methods towards application, papers that apply these methods to challenging and realistic engineering cases in general are also welcomed, especially if the non-probabilistic or hybrid models for the uncertainty are based on real data. Indicative Topics: â€¢ New theoretical developments in the modeling of, and simulation with non-probabilistic or hybrid representations of uncertainty such as intervals, fuzzy sets, set-valued approaches, interval probabilities, credal sets, Dempster-Shafer belief functions, interval fields, or imprecise random fields. â€¢ Efficient propagation schemes for such non-probabilistic or hybrid representations, including new algorithmic developments, surrogate models, model order reduction, or low-rank representations.

3D-Printed Organs Becoming Reality,"ASME TechReboot - ME Magazine Newsletter Quiz on the History of Self-Driving Cars 03.05.2020 Podcast: Building Energy Resiliency in the Caribbean The Caribbean island of Bonaire is an idyllic vacation spot, but its power generation and grid system was unreliable. When ContourGlobal bought the energy assets it knew the system had to be reworked. The result was a 24-MW system using wind and solar, along with backup diesel generators, coupled with a lithium-ion battery storage system and a digital management system that ties it together. 3D-Printed Organs Nearing Clinical Trials Thanks to 3D bioprinting and electrospinning, Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine bioengineers are moving artificial skin and blood vessels closer to clinical testing. They are also making progress on such 3D-printed organs as hearts, livers, and kidneys. Energy Blog: Our Energy and Climate Policies are Counterproductive When it comes to energy and transportation, the biggest policy failures have to do with climate pollution. Our current policies have us locked into outcomes that run counter to what most people want. QUIZ: What Do You Know About Autonomous Vehicles? The first driverless car debuted in 1939 at the General Motors exhibit at the New York World's Fair. Created by famed industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes, the car was not fully autonomous. Why not? It was driven by an operator using remote radio control. It had a hidden driver in the trunk. It could only follow magnetic spikes embedded in the track. Its computer was too small for independent decision making.

Sponsored Ad VA System Rolls Out 3D Printing The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the nation's largest integrated health care system, is currently exploring ways in which 3D printing can solve a wide range of problems, from visualizing organs before surgery to personalized medicine and improved prostheses. Dr. Beth Ripley is leading the project and she explains how VA is planning to roll out 3D printing throughout the system. Sponsored Content How Gallium Nitride Enables Smaller, More Efficient Power Supplies One of the most common transistors in switching power supplies is a metalâ€“oxideâ€“semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET).

Learn how PTC 19.1 Test Uncertainty can help you evaluate risk at our webinar,"Register today for ASME's webinar on PTC 19.1 Test Uncertainty Connect with us: Measuring uncertainty can help you to evaluate risk Within any test, thereâ€™s a certain level of risk that something could go wrong. This can lead to inaccurate results, which can influence decisions, putting resources, budgets and even lives in danger. PTC 19.1 helps you to identify the reliability and quality of measurements across different test variables and methodologies. This enables you to make more informed decisions, so you can optimize your test variables and design, which can provide more accurate test results. And, in turn this can lead to better decisions, down-the-line, from the people who are using your test data to help guide their decisions on resources, budgets and factors that could mean the difference between life and death. Register today for our upcoming webinar, where you'll learn about: â€¢ Classification systems used to quantify errors and uncertainties â€¢ The Taylor Series Method and Monte Carlo Method â€“ two internationally accepted uncertainty propagation methods â€¢ Value of performing a pretest and post-test uncertainty analysis, along with the importance of effectively communicating test results â€¢ How performing an uncertainty analysis can help you to evaluate risk and make more informed decisions when designing your tests To register for the webinar or purchase the latest version of the standard, click on the buttons below.

Explore how PTC 19.1 can lead to better test results,"Register today for ASME's webinar on PTC 19.1 Test Uncertainty Connect with us: Build confidence in your results by using PTC 19.1 to help reduce uncertainty When conducting a test, every decision matters, as errors can occur with each variable you include, negatively impacting your results. An error is the difference between a measurement and its expected true value. And uncertainties quantify the limits of error within which the true value should lie. Discover how PTC 19.1 can help you to make more meaningful decisions across your test process by measuring the level of uncertainty for each variable. By doing so, you can optimize your testâ€™s performance and minimize any errors, helping to build confidence in your results. Register today for our upcoming webinar where youâ€™ll learn about: â€¢ Classification systems used to quantify errors and uncertainties â€¢ The Taylor Series Method and Monte Carlo Method - two internationally accepted error propagation methods â€¢ Value of performing a pretest and post-test uncertainty analysis, along with the importance of effectively communicating test results â€¢ How performing an uncertainty analysis can help you to evaluate risk and make more informed decisions when designing your tests To register for the webinar or purchase the latest version of the standard, click on the buttons below.

3D Printing Goes Nuclear,"ASME TechReboot - ME Magazine Newsletter Physic-Based Simulations for the Machine Learning Systems 09.10.2020 Five Key Trends in Industrial Connectivity Heavy-duty industrial connectors are being preferred to hardwiring/lugging in wiring modular machines and systems for IoT networks. Here are five key trends that demonstrate how connectivity supports digitalization and new possibilities in machine and systems design. Sponsored Ad 3D Printing Goes Critical with Nuclear Reactor Core The design and materials of nuclear reactors haven't changed much since the 1950s. Now, a team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is following a data-driven approach to build a 3D-printed nuclear reactor core prototype that could enable nuclear plants to run more efficiently. Bioengineering Blog: Physics-based Simulation Helps Train Machine-Learning Systems Simulation is not meant to be a replacement for all physical testing in medical devices. Prototypes, bench tests, preclinical labs, and clinical studies are not replaced by modeling and simulation, but when used side by side, they become more efficient at reaching project goals. Sponsored Ad WEBINAR Design and Optimization of a BMR Loudspeaker Drive Unit October 15 | 2 pm ET Balanced mode radiator drive units are experiencing widespread adoption due to their full bandwidth, wide directivity radiation field that is largely decoupled from their physical size. Although the behavior of the diaphragm is unique, the remaining key elements of the drive unit, such as the motor and suspension structures, require similar optimization to conventional drive units. COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ® will highlight some of the key design steps including the incorporation of the Magnetic Fields, Solid Mechanics, and Pressure Acoustics physics interfaces. L&D CORNER Expansion Joints: How Thermal Expansion Solutions Can Become Big Pressure Problems Almost all industrial facilities - whether process, power, manufacturing or research - have at least one and often many expansion joints to provide engineered solutions for issues such as thermal expansion, piping fit-up, equipment nozzle loads and vibration isolation. Sometimes they are a last resort. Other times, they are widely accepted as an extra means of safety.

Call for Papers: Special Issue on Uncertainty Quantification and Management in Additive Manufacturing,"ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Eng. Systems ASME's Guide for Journal Authors Submit Manuscript â†’ CALL FOR PAPERSASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems, Part B: Mechanical EngineeringSpecial Issue on Uncertainty Quantification and Management in Additive Manufacturing (SI046B) Additive Manufacturing (AM) represents a new paradigm of manufacturing where parts are manufactured using their 3D models (such as CAD models) by joining materials in a layer-by-layer manner. AM can have significant impact on the economies all over the world, as it tends to be more sustainable (in terms of material wastage) compared to traditional manufacturing processes. Widespread implementation of AM requires robust techniques for performance evaluation, quality control, and certification. In reality, manufacturing processes are impacted by heterogeneous uncertainty sources at various stages of a manufacturing process, such as raw materials, process equipment, process parameters, process simulation models, and sensors. Therefore, techniques of Uncertainty Quantification and Management (UQ&M) are essential for the quality control and certification of AM processes. With the development of advanced simulation techniques, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics, new UQ&M approaches are emerging to enable model-based quality control and certification, data-driven quality monitoring, and AI-based quality assurance in AM. This Special Issue is dedicated to recent advances in the field of UQ&M with application in AM. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following: AM process design under uncertainty Model-based uncertainty quantification in AM Uncertainty quantification in AM with heterogeneous data sources Machine learning techniques (e.g., deep learning) for UQ&M in AM Validation and certification of AM process under uncertainty Reliability analysis in AM Health monitoring, diagnostics, prognostics, and control of AM processes under uncertainty Heterogeneous, multi-modal, and multi-scale data fusion under uncertainty for UQ&M in AM Sensitivity analysis in AM under uncertainty Publication Target Dates Paper submission opens: November 1, 2020 Paper submission deadline: February 1, 2021 First reviews completed: June 1, 2021 Second reviews completed: September 30, 2021 Special Issue finalized: November 2021 Submission Instructions Papers should be submitted electronically to the journal at journaltool.asme.org.

CALL FOR PAPERS: Special Issue on AI and Engineering Design,"Journal of Mechanical Design ASME's Guide for Journal AuthorsView Journal Video Submit Manuscript â†’ CALL FOR PAPERSASME Journal of Mechanical DesignSpecial Issue on Artificial Intelligence and Engineering Design Artificial Intelligence (AI) has advanced tremendously and has the potential to intersect the engineering design process in a variety of ways. For instance, designers could use AI to support more automatic and intelligent knowledge extraction and knowledge representation, to support early design ideation -- making the creation of products with enhanced multifunctionality possible, or even to discover design solutions to previously unrealized functions. Additionally, AI methods have great potential to solve problems where human intuition or human processing capabilities are insufficient, making it possible to expand the richness of design spaces that can be navigated effectively through AI support. Further, used as an identification tool, AI could enable more efficient and higher-performance design solutions during design revision at the manufacturing and assembly level by screening and identifying part consolidation design and multifunctional design potentials. An inverse perspective is also possible, where results from engineering design research, such as design automation methods, could be used to rapidly generate rich and tailored data sets that amplify the impact of AI methods. Furthermore, engineering design challenges and knowledge from design research could help inform new advancements in AI. Topic AreasThe following is a non-comprehensive list of representative topics within scope of this Special Issue: Descriptive knowledge extraction, representation and reasoning techniques for design using AI Early-stage design concept generation and exploration enabled by AI methods Designer-AI interaction (e.g., cognitive assistants for design) Applications of natural language processing to engineering design Capitalizing on product/system lifecycle datasets using AI AI-enabled material, metamaterial, and material system modeling and design Characterization and exploration of AI-systems robustness-performance tradeoffs Design methods for AI-enabled autonomous engineering systems (e.g., phones and autonomous vehicles) AI applied to Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cyber systems design and decision-making Survey, review, and assessment of challenges and opportunities at the interface of AI and engineering design AI-assisted design of mechanisms and other mechanical systems Education of AI for engineering design Publication Target Dates Paper submission deadline: April 1, 2021 Initial review completed: June 15, 2021 Final decision: September 1, 2021 Special Issue publication date: December, 2021 Submission Instructions Papers should be submitted electronically to the journal at journaltool.asme.org.

For instance, designers could use AI to support more automatic and intelligent knowledge extraction and knowledge representation, to support early design ideation -- making the creation of products with enhanced multifunctionality possible, or even to discover design solutions to previously unrealized functions. Additionally, AI methods have great potential to solve problems where human intuition or human processing capabilities are insufficient, making it possible to expand the richness of design spaces that can be navigated effectively through AI support. Further, used as an identification tool, AI could enable more efficient and higher-performance design solutions during design revision at the manufacturing and assembly level by screening and identifying part consolidation design and multifunctional design potentials. An inverse perspective is also possible, where results from engineering design research, such as design automation methods, could be used to rapidly generate rich and tailored data sets that amplify the impact of AI methods. Furthermore, engineering design challenges and knowledge from design research could help inform new advancements in AI. Topic AreasThe following is a non-comprehensive list of representative topics within scope of this Special Issue: Descriptive knowledge extraction, representation and reasoning techniques for design using AI Early-stage design concept generation and exploration enabled by AI methods Designer-AI interaction (e.g., cognitive assistants for design) Applications of natural language processing to engineering design Capitalizing on product/system lifecycle datasets using AI AI-enabled material, metamaterial, and material system modeling and design Characterization and exploration of AI-systems robustness-performance tradeoffs Design methods for AI-enabled autonomous engineering systems (e.g., phones and autonomous vehicles) AI applied to Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cyber systems design and decision-making Survey, review, and assessment of challenges and opportunities at the interface of AI and engineering design AI-assisted design of mechanisms and other mechanical systems Education of AI for engineering design Publication Target Dates Paper submission deadline: April 1, 2021 Initial review completed: June 15, 2021 Final decision: September 1, 2021 Special Issue publication date: December, 2021 Submission Instructions Papers should be submitted electronically to the journal at journaltool.asme.org.

The majority of these stocks are trading near their 52-week high.

Below are a few challenges faced by PSUs: Hasty lending Economic slowdown Asset quality review by RBI that discovered a huge amount of NPAs Here are a few developments government has taken to improve the performance of the PSU banks: Government support: In the past few years, banks had to make provisions for bad loans worth over Rs. 10 lakh crores. In the last five years, the government has infused Rs. 3.1 lakh crore to recapitalise the banks. Of these, 35,000 crores were from budgetary allocations, and the remainder, Rs. 2.75 lakh crore, were infused by recapitalisation bonds. Bad loans worth Rs.5.4 lakh crore was written off from PSBs books, of which 37% admitted that they had recovered the claims. PSU banks have performed better than private banks relatively as far as corporate slippages are considered. Once considered troublesome, the corporate loan book is pushing its loan growth organically. Better Asset quality, loan demand, and rising profit margins drive strong earnings. High public and private Capex and increasing utilisation of working capital requirements pushed up the corporate loan book. Credit growth is witnessing strong momentum from decadal lows on solid retail consumer demand. Combined net profit of banks up more than 50% vs Q2FY22.

Where have the ‘tech’ IPOs gone?,"Dear Lovina, In this week's Markets, we will talk about tech IPOs and see why they've vanished all of a sudden The Story In February, audio wear company boAt announced that it was ready to go public. They put together the paperwork, drummed up support and were all set to raise money from the public. But just a couple of weeks ago, boAt decided to abandon those plans. Not necessarily abandon, but froze all plans for now. And boAt isn’t the only one to do this. Used-car marketplace Droom and online pharmacy PharmEasy have also pulled the plug on their IPOs. Even fintech major Mobikwik seems to have shelved all plans to go public for now. So this begs the question — Why? After all, the Indian stock market is doing pretty well. Some indices have even hit all-time highs and domestic investors continue to pour money into the market. This kind of environment should be ideal for an IPO no? Especially when you see other “boring” companies go public— 35-year-old snack firms, cable manufacturers, NBFCs and chemical companies. So why are tech companies getting cold feet? Well, let’s go back to something we wrote during boAt’s first IPO announcement. You see, in January 2021 boAt raised $100 million from PE firm Warburg Pincus. It was valued at $300 million. But when the IPO was announced, boAt’s valuation suddenly jumped 7x. To nearly $2 billion. What was the rationale for this massive jump in valuation? We don’t know. Maybe it was simply because they could command anything they desired! People were going gaga over these ‘new-age’ companies. Everyone wanted to bet on startups. VC firms had poured $38.5 billion into Indian startups in 2021–3.8 times as much as they did in 2020! So you could argue that most tech companies felt that they could extend these inflated valuations to the public markets as well. But the reality is that the public markets don’t operate the same way private markets do. Private investors are okay with playing the long game. They’re happy if a company delivers on revenue growth and adds new users. They’re hoping companies can create categories of their own and they aren’t too focused on the bottom line. But public markets want to see one thing — profits. And they want to see it every quarter, trending upwards. So you can imagine that start-ups burning boatloads of cash won’t make them too happy. Just look at what happened in 2021 when plenty of new-age companies went to Dalal Street. We’re talking about the likes of PayTM, Zomato, CarTrade, and Nykaa. These companies bet that people would pay through their noses just to get their hands on these stocks. But they’ve had no such luck. Most of them are trading at 50% below the price at which they first listed on the stock exchanges. And it finally looks like the ‘new-age’ companies have woken up and smelt the coffee. It doesn’t matter that the Sensex and Nifty are doing fairly well. Tech companies aren’t in favour. And they probably won’t be until they show profits. That’s why many of them have resorted to layoffs as well. They’re trying to cut costs as quickly as possible. Even bankers could be hesitant to support tech IPOs at exorbitant valuations. Because here’s the thing…when bankers serve as advisors on these IPOs, they also have to ‘underwrite’ it. This means that if the IPO sees lacklustre demand and the shares aren’t lapped up, the bank may have to step in and buy the shares itself. Now a bank wouldn’t want to end up damaging its own bottom line by buying shares at insane valuations, no? But there’s something else… Market regulator SEBI has been watching all this with a hawk’s eye. They’ve seen the exorbitant valuations. And last month, they took some action. Now, companies have to make more disclosures before going public. They have to explain how they price the IPO. Sure, SEBI won’t tell companies how to price their issue. But it will ask them to shed some light on the process itself. The thing is disclosures in a 500-page document alone may not amount to much. Investors knew these companies were loss-making. Yet, they invested in these stocks anyway. So what else can SEBI do? Maybe it can create an implicit barrier. The regulator seems to have slammed the brakes on doling out IPO approvals. See once a company files their documents, SEBI takes some time to go through it all. They want to make sure that the issue doesn’t damage prospective investors. And it takes time to do this. In 2020 and 2021, SEBI took 75 days on average to grant approvals. But in 2022, the average has jumped by 50%!!! Companies are now having to wait for 115 days to know their fate. The last time the regulator took so long to clear IPOs was way back in 2014. Put all this together and you can see why ‘new-age’ companies are being ultra-cautious now. They don’t want a bad rep. And they don’t want to get on the wrong side of SEBI. They’d much rather wait and weather the storm. Okay, but hold on now…aren’t IPOs lined up when companies are in need of money to expand and stuff? Where will they get the money now? That’s true. But only partly. You see, an IPO is the holy grail for any company. It’s a sign that the company is a legitimate enterprise that’s serious about making a mark in the world. For ‘new-age companies’, going public is validation. A sign that they’ve made it. They may not have necessarily needed the money. And in case they did, well, they could always turn to the private markets again. Raise money from PEs and VCs — as boAt did by raising ₹500 crores. What about the funding winter in the VC world, you ask? Well, the winter isn’t because money isn’t readily available. It’s simply because the environment is so uncertain that VC firms are not sure which companies to take a punt on anymore. In fact, Inc42 says that Indian VCs are sitting on $16 billion worth of dry powder (money that’s ready and simply waiting to be deployed). So in many cases, VCs are willing to bet a chunk of the money on companies that have already shown some promise. They want to back horses that have proven they can win the race. So yeah, there’s money for now. And it could be just a temporary lull for ‘new-age’ tech IPOs. They’ll be back. When? We don’t know yet. Until then… Don't forget to share this Finshots on Twitter and WhatsApp. A simple checklist for picking the best health insurance for you & your loved ones 1) Don’t split the Bill — Insurers might nudge you to consider a co-payment clause, in which case, you’ll be forced to foot a part of the bill each time you make a claim. This might not be the best option unless you have no choice, or are purchasing for elderly citizens.2) Restrictions on room & room rent — Some insurers will have a limit on room rent. And if you breach this limit, they’ll make you pay extra for every little service rendered in the room. So opt for a policy that doesn’t have too many restrictions on this front.3.) Check for Disease Wise Sub-limits — It’s what happens when the insurer offers you a massive cover for a modest fee, only to include restrictions on coverage for each disease. So make sure you check these sub-limits before making a decision.4.) Seek a Low Waiting Period — If you have pre-existing diseases (including diabetes, blood pressure, etc), you might have to wait a fixed period (typically 2–4 years) before you’re covered.- It’s best to pick a policy where you don’t have to wait a lot.5.) Coverage for daycare treatments:- Chemotherapy, dialysis, a quick appendectomy- all these procedures might last less than 24 hours. And some insurers might not cover these claims, because they don’t do “daycare treatments”. So make sure you check for daycare coverage!Finally, if you need more specific advice on what to buy, you can always talk to our advisors at Ditto.1. Go to Ditto’s website — Link here2.

Dear Lovina, In this week's Markets, we will talk about tech IPOs and see why they've vanished all of a sudden The Story In February, audio wear company boAt announced that it was ready to go public. They put together the paperwork, drummed up support and were all set to raise money from the public. But just a couple of weeks ago, boAt decided to abandon those plans. Not necessarily abandon, but froze all plans for now. And boAt isn’t the only one to do this. Used-car marketplace Droom and online pharmacy PharmEasy have also pulled the plug on their IPOs. Even fintech major Mobikwik seems to have shelved all plans to go public for now. So this begs the question — Why? After all, the Indian stock market is doing pretty well. Some indices have even hit all-time highs and domestic investors continue to pour money into the market. This kind of environment should be ideal for an IPO no? Especially when you see other “boring” companies go public— 35-year-old snack firms, cable manufacturers, NBFCs and chemical companies. So why are tech companies getting cold feet? Well, let’s go back to something we wrote during boAt’s first IPO announcement. You see, in January 2021 boAt raised $100 million from PE firm Warburg Pincus. It was valued at $300 million. But when the IPO was announced, boAt’s valuation suddenly jumped 7x. To nearly $2 billion. What was the rationale for this massive jump in valuation? We don’t know. Maybe it was simply because they could command anything they desired! People were going gaga over these ‘new-age’ companies. Everyone wanted to bet on startups. VC firms had poured $38.5 billion into Indian startups in 2021–3.8 times as much as they did in 2020! So you could argue that most tech companies felt that they could extend these inflated valuations to the public markets as well. But the reality is that the public markets don’t operate the same way private markets do. Private investors are okay with playing the long game. They’re happy if a company delivers on revenue growth and adds new users. They’re hoping companies can create categories of their own and they aren’t too focused on the bottom line. But public markets want to see one thing — profits. And they want to see it every quarter, trending upwards. So you can imagine that start-ups burning boatloads of cash won’t make them too happy. Just look at what happened in 2021 when plenty of new-age companies went to Dalal Street. We’re talking about the likes of PayTM, Zomato, CarTrade, and Nykaa. These companies bet that people would pay through their noses just to get their hands on these stocks. But they’ve had no such luck. Most of them are trading at 50% below the price at which they first listed on the stock exchanges. And it finally looks like the ‘new-age’ companies have woken up and smelt the coffee. It doesn’t matter that the Sensex and Nifty are doing fairly well. Tech companies aren’t in favour. And they probably won’t be until they show profits. That’s why many of them have resorted to layoffs as well. They’re trying to cut costs as quickly as possible. Even bankers could be hesitant to support tech IPOs at exorbitant valuations. Because here’s the thing…when bankers serve as advisors on these IPOs, they also have to ‘underwrite’ it. This means that if the IPO sees lacklustre demand and the shares aren’t lapped up, the bank may have to step in and buy the shares itself. Now a bank wouldn’t want to end up damaging its own bottom line by buying shares at insane valuations, no? But there’s something else… Market regulator SEBI has been watching all this with a hawk’s eye. They’ve seen the exorbitant valuations. And last month, they took some action. Now, companies have to make more disclosures before going public. They have to explain how they price the IPO. Sure, SEBI won’t tell companies how to price their issue. But it will ask them to shed some light on the process itself. The thing is disclosures in a 500-page document alone may not amount to much. Investors knew these companies were loss-making. Yet, they invested in these stocks anyway. So what else can SEBI do? Maybe it can create an implicit barrier. The regulator seems to have slammed the brakes on doling out IPO approvals. See once a company files their documents, SEBI takes some time to go through it all. They want to make sure that the issue doesn’t damage prospective investors. And it takes time to do this. In 2020 and 2021, SEBI took 75 days on average to grant approvals. But in 2022, the average has jumped by 50%!!! Companies are now having to wait for 115 days to know their fate.

What went wrong at Dhanlaxmi Bank?,"Dear Lovina, In this week's Finshots Markets, we trace the journey of Dhanlaxmi Bank The Story Running a bank is simple, right? You raise deposits. You mobilize funds. You lend some money out and you keep the interest. And as long as you keep doling out money to creditworthy individuals who pay you back in time, you’ll be good as gold. You just need to keep repeating this simple maxim. Seems easy enough, no? Well, tell that to the shareholders of 95-year-old Kerala-based Dhanlaxmi Bank. The bank’s share price has crashed by 93% since 2010. It’s almost a penny stock now (below ₹10). Meaning if you has invested ₹1 lakh back in 2010, you would be left with a paltry sum of ₹7,000 now. And last week, the shareholders had enough. They think that the CEO is spending money willy-nilly when the bank is already in dire straits. So they revolted. They now want to restrict his spending power. So if he wants to open new branches, that won’t be possible. If he wants to upgrade the IT systems, that’s a no go too. He can only pay staff salaries and he can’t do much else. That’s harsh! Now here’s the thing…this isn’t the first time shareholders have revolted at Dhanlaxmi Bank. And it probably won’t be the last. But to understand what’s going on, we have to understand the legacy bank’s history. Since its inception in the 1920s, Dhanlaxmi Bank followed the basic principles of banking. Raise deposits. Lend money. Pocket the interest. And it did this quite well. It focused on building relationships with small businesses. It built up its retail book slowly and steadily. It stuck to its area of competence and didn’t experiment all that much. But times change and the bank didn’t want to be left behind. It wanted to change its image — from a sleepy old legacy bank to a nimble gazelle. It wanted to be tech-savvy. It wanted a pan-India presence. And in 2008, Amitabh Chaturvedi came on board to usher in a new era for the regional bank. He was someone who’d risen through the ranks at ICICI Bank and then at Reliance Capital. Everyone believed he could bring private sector aggression into Dhanlaxmi. It worked. In just 3 years, the bank’s loan book grew from ₹2,500 crores to ₹10,100 crores. Its deposits surged from ₹3,400 crores to ₹13,800 crores. It opened 66 new branches across the country. And its employee strength tripled. Chaturvedi also did this by staying in the good books of the Trade Union. He raised salary levels, gave jobs to the employees’ children, and he even offered to relocate the Keralites working in other metros. Things were looking up. Oh, he actually changed the name of the bank — from Dhanalakshmi to Dhanlaxmi. Don’t ask why! But all this came at a cost. And the cracks began to appear soon after. Expenses were rising out of line. Income began lagging behind. The old guard began retiring and new employees weren’t allowed to join the employees’ union. 3 years into his tenure, tensions flared up again. In October 2011, the employees’ union said that the top management was window-dressing the accounts. That they were finding novel ways to show profits. That they were recognising income that they didn’t receive upfront, while staggering expenses over a period of time. The RBI got involved and began an investigation. After all, the capital adequacy ratio — a figure that tells you about the kind of money available to cushion against future losses, fell from 14.44% in 2011 to 10.81% in 2009. The bank was pursuing its expansionary goals too quickly by spreading itself too thin. The Bank’s board stopped backing Chaturvedi. They wanted him to cease the wanton expansion and cut back on lending. And he did. Soon, income dried up, while the costs remained elevated. Chaturvedi really had no option but to quit the bank. And by August 2012, its auditor Walker Chandiok and Co. threw its hands in the air and resigned too. Something to do with financial irregularities. Things were so bad that in 2015, the RBI stepped in. The regulator placed the bank under something called the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. Being put on this list is usually bad news. Sure, the objective is to ensure that the bank protects its capital and does not go bust. But it also means restrictions on lending out money. You know, the very things that pad the coffers. And it took nearly 4 years for the bank to get its financial act together and become a free bird again. Well, sort of. Because financial matters are one thing. But what if there’s another problem? The elephant in the room — Culture. For a Kerala-based legacy bank trying to find its feet in the new world, the biggest hurdle was preserving the ‘culture’ built so painstakingly over the years. You see, between 2003 and 2020, the Bank had 7 CEOs. And 5 of them did not last their full term. Even seasoned Board members jumped ship citing problems with the management and a toothless board. And when in 2020, the RBI appointed Sunil Gurbaxani as the CEO, shareholders waited just 6 months before ousting him. Apparently, he was making the same mistakes as his predecessors — ignoring the bank’s South Indian roots in the quest for growth. At that time, the general secretary of the All India Bank Employees’ Association wrote to the RBI Governor. His request was simple — “Please find a person who understands the bank’s history. Its legacy. Its customers and shareholders.” Or, as one expert told Forbes, “Essentially, the problem is that Dhanlaxmi is a Kerala-based bank, and as management, you really need to understand the local sentiments. You need to behave and act like a local to win over the shareholders which had been missing for many years.” Running a bank isn’t so simple after all. Being overly aggressive is one thing, but, you need to cater to ‘sentiments’ too it seems. Especially if you’re an outsider who has been brought in to run the show. You’re beholden to the shareholders and their whims and fancies. So you could argue that shareholders ought to be selecting the top brass then? And they kind of did. The next appointment was Kerala-based banking veteran J K Shivan. In fact, the RBI actually asked the bank’s board to get support from the shareholders before appointing him. Which they did. 99.81% of the shareholders gave the green light. But barely 1.5 years later, it’s the same J K Shivan who’s facing the ire of shareholders. It’s his powers they want to curtail now. So now the question is — if an RBI-appointed person isn’t good enough; if someone the shareholders chose is also not good enough; what’s next for the bank that’s clinging on to its ‘DNA’? Also, how responsible is the RBI for this mess — You see, the RBI has nominees on the board of the bank too and it’s being accused of sleeping at the wheel. How will Dhanlaxmi Bank get out of this mess? The simple answer is that it needs to urgently raise capital to get its house in order. But it also needs to sort out the constant battle among the shareholders, board, and management. If that doesn’t happen, it won’t be the last time you hear about troubles at the 95-year-old Dhanlaxmi Bank. Until then… Don't forget to share this Finshots on Twitter and WhatsApp. Ditto Insights: The best way to save on health insurance premiums A recent survey claims that 38% of Indians saw their health insurance premiums rise by 50% in just a year!! It’s no secret that insurance is becoming costly every year with treatment costs on the rise. Here are a few ways you can avail discounts on your plan to massively save on premiums: 1. Multi-year plans: In case you’re unaware, a multi-year plan is an amazing way to save on premiums. Insurers offer customers the option to lock in premiums for 2–3 years by paying a lumpsum amount. This is often accompanied by discounts in the range of 10–12%. Now you might say- “This is just another way for insurers to make more money”. But price hikes have become common nowadays and with medical inflation at major highs, buying a multi-year plan makes some sense. 2. Wellness Discounts- Every insurer wants its policyholder to stay fit. If no health issues come up, insurers can kick back & relax. This is why they’ll offer you discounts if you show some initiative to remain healthy. This may be judged through a series of tests or may be measured by how many steps you walk in a day. Either way, you have another incentive to stay fit :) 3. Buying early: Some insurers even offer you discounts if you buy really early in life. What’s more, when you buy when you’re young and healthy you get very comprehensive policies at low premiums. And if you’re looking to buy comprehensive health insurance, you can always talk to our advisors at Ditto. 1. Just head to our website — Link here 2. Click on “Book a FREE call” 3.

Everyone believed he could bring private sector aggression into Dhanlaxmi. It worked. In just 3 years, the bank’s loan book grew from ₹2,500 crores to ₹10,100 crores. Its deposits surged from ₹3,400 crores to ₹13,800 crores. It opened 66 new branches across the country. And its employee strength tripled. Chaturvedi also did this by staying in the good books of the Trade Union. He raised salary levels, gave jobs to the employees’ children, and he even offered to relocate the Keralites working in other metros. Things were looking up. Oh, he actually changed the name of the bank — from Dhanalakshmi to Dhanlaxmi. Don’t ask why! But all this came at a cost. And the cracks began to appear soon after. Expenses were rising out of line. Income began lagging behind. The old guard began retiring and new employees weren’t allowed to join the employees’ union. 3 years into his tenure, tensions flared up again. In October 2011, the employees’ union said that the top management was window-dressing the accounts. That they were finding novel ways to show profits. That they were recognising income that they didn’t receive upfront, while staggering expenses over a period of time. The RBI got involved and began an investigation. After all, the capital adequacy ratio — a figure that tells you about the kind of money available to cushion against future losses, fell from 14.44% in 2011 to 10.81% in 2009. The bank was pursuing its expansionary goals too quickly by spreading itself too thin. The Bank’s board stopped backing Chaturvedi. They wanted him to cease the wanton expansion and cut back on lending. And he did. Soon, income dried up, while the costs remained elevated. Chaturvedi really had no option but to quit the bank. And by August 2012, its auditor Walker Chandiok and Co. threw its hands in the air and resigned too. Something to do with financial irregularities. Things were so bad that in 2015, the RBI stepped in. The regulator placed the bank under something called the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. Being put on this list is usually bad news. Sure, the objective is to ensure that the bank protects its capital and does not go bust. But it also means restrictions on lending out money. You know, the very things that pad the coffers. And it took nearly 4 years for the bank to get its financial act together and become a free bird again. Well, sort of. Because financial matters are one thing. But what if there’s another problem? The elephant in the room — Culture. For a Kerala-based legacy bank trying to find its feet in the new world, the biggest hurdle was preserving the ‘culture’ built so painstakingly over the years. You see, between 2003 and 2020, the Bank had 7 CEOs. And 5 of them did not last their full term. Even seasoned Board members jumped ship citing problems with the management and a toothless board. And when in 2020, the RBI appointed Sunil Gurbaxani as the CEO, shareholders waited just 6 months before ousting him. Apparently, he was making the same mistakes as his predecessors — ignoring the bank’s South Indian roots in the quest for growth. At that time, the general secretary of the All India Bank Employees’ Association wrote to the RBI Governor. His request was simple — “Please find a person who understands the bank’s history. Its legacy. Its customers and shareholders.” Or, as one expert told Forbes, “Essentially, the problem is that Dhanlaxmi is a Kerala-based bank, and as management, you really need to understand the local sentiments. You need to behave and act like a local to win over the shareholders which had been missing for many years.” Running a bank isn’t so simple after all. Being overly aggressive is one thing, but, you need to cater to ‘sentiments’ too it seems. Especially if you’re an outsider who has been brought in to run the show. You’re beholden to the shareholders and their whims and fancies. So you could argue that shareholders ought to be selecting the top brass then? And they kind of did. The next appointment was Kerala-based banking veteran J K Shivan. In fact, the RBI actually asked the bank’s board to get support from the shareholders before appointing him. Which they did. 99.81% of the shareholders gave the green light. But barely 1.5 years later, it’s the same J K Shivan who’s facing the ire of shareholders. It’s his powers they want to curtail now. So now the question is — if an RBI-appointed person isn’t good enough; if someone the shareholders chose is also not good enough; what’s next for the bank that’s clinging on to its ‘DNA’? Also, how responsible is the RBI for this mess — You see, the RBI has nominees on the board of the bank too and it’s being accused of sleeping at the wheel. How will Dhanlaxmi Bank get out of this mess? The simple answer is that it needs to urgently raise capital to get its house in order. But it also needs to sort out the constant battle among the shareholders, board, and management. If that doesn’t happen, it won’t be the last time you hear about troubles at the 95-year-old Dhanlaxmi Bank. Until then… Don't forget to share this Finshots on Twitter and WhatsApp. Ditto Insights: The best way to save on health insurance premiums A recent survey claims that 38% of Indians saw their health insurance premiums rise by 50% in just a year!! It’s no secret that insurance is becoming costly every year with treatment costs on the rise. Here are a few ways you can avail discounts on your plan to massively save on premiums: 1. Multi-year plans: In case you’re unaware, a multi-year plan is an amazing way to save on premiums. Insurers offer customers the option to lock in premiums for 2–3 years by paying a lumpsum amount. This is often accompanied by discounts in the range of 10–12%. Now you might say- “This is just another way for insurers to make more money”. But price hikes have become common nowadays and with medical inflation at major highs, buying a multi-year plan makes some sense. 2. Wellness Discounts- Every insurer wants its policyholder to stay fit. If no health issues come up, insurers can kick back & relax. This is why they’ll offer you discounts if you show some initiative to remain healthy. This may be judged through a series of tests or may be measured by how many steps you walk in a day. Either way, you have another incentive to stay fit :) 3. Buying early: Some insurers even offer you discounts if you buy really early in life. What’s more, when you buy when you’re young and healthy you get very comprehensive policies at low premiums. And if you’re looking to buy comprehensive health insurance, you can always talk to our advisors at Ditto. 1. Just head to our website — Link here 2. Click on “Book a FREE call” 3.

This Dhanteras, invest in Gold Mutual Funds,spam,This Dhanteras  invest in Gold Mutual Funds
Gold is dead. Long live Gold!,"Dear Lovina, In today’s Finshots, we dive into whether gold’s role as a hedge against inflation is broken. The Story It’s the season of festivities in India. Dhanteras and Diwali are just around the corner. And there’s one thing that people love to buy during this time — gold! Now if you look at gold prices in India, you’ll think that the metal is having a pretty decent year. While the stock markets are down nearly 3%, gold prices are up by 5% during the past 12 months. But here’s the thing. It’s kind of an illusion. It does not reflect what’s happening to gold in the US. Prices have actually dropped by nearly 10%!!! Wait…how is such a thing even possible? Well, gold is a bit like oil. Globally, people buy and sell gold using the US dollar. And this means the value of Gold is inextricably tied to the value of the US dollar. So if the value of the dollar appreciates considerably, then the value of gold could also rise in tandem since it’s denominated in dollars (from an importer's perspective). And that’s precisely what’s happening. The US dollar has been rallying like there’s no tomorrow (we wrote about this yesterday). Currencies across the world have lost value against the dollar. One year ago, ₹73 would’ve got you $1. Today, you need to pony up nearly ₹83 to get that same $1. That means importing $55 billion worth of gold (like we did in 2021) will translate to a higher outgo of Rupees. When it lands on our shores, our import bill will reflect this difference. There’s also the fact that India has increased duties on gold imports from 7.5% to 12.5%. So put together, the weaker Rupee and the import duty have been responsible for pushing domestic gold prices higher. Which brings us to the big question — why aren’t global gold prices actually rallying? After all, it should be the perfect time to own gold, no? Inflation is through the roof. In some cases, by 10%! And the yellow metal is typically heralded as the perfect hedge against inflation. So what’s going on really? For starters, there’s the matter of consumption or affordability itself. Countries that import gold have to cough up a pretty penny because of the dollar's strength. And that dampens the demand for the metal. Because at the end of it all, gold is still a luxury that not everyone can afford. So if your domestic economy is not doing that well or when the US dollar rises, you’ll postpone your purchase decision. That’s why there is a negative relationship between the dollar and gold. Sidebar: Demand for gold in India still seems to be fairly robust though. Then there’s the bit about gold investors. See, the US has been increasing interest rates to battle inflation. And US government bonds now offer attractive yields. So as an investor you can make a pretty penny by investing in these bonds as opposed to parking your money in gold. And with Gold, you also have to work with uncertainty. Yes, the price of gold could appreciate considerably. But if it doesn’t you’ll be losing money. So in an uncertain environment, people may still prefer US government bonds over gold. Also, gold’s role as a hedge against inflation has always been in question. In the past decade, Indian investors who decided to diversify into gold have made a measly 3.4% a year. That’s way below inflation. The only thing going for gold perhaps is the fact that the biggest holders of gold aren’t giving up. We’re talking about central banks, of course! The folks who hold 20% of the world’s gold have been lapping up gold in the past few months. They’re beefing up their reserves and it seems like gold is still the preferred medium for that. So yeah, we don’t know what’ll happen with gold. But if you have any thoughts, tell us. Is gold a part of your eternal Dhanteras wish list or do you think the yellow metal is dead?

It’s All Gas,"Dear Lovina, In today’s Finshots, we offer a simplified explanation of why gas distribution companies like Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas are feeling the pinch these days The Story A couple of weeks ago, I was travelling to meet a friend in Bengaluru and I noticed the driver scoffing at the price of Compressed Natural Gas (or CNG). I quickly checked my phone to confirm and there it was — prices were on the rise. In fact, the price had risen by a whopping 80% in just one year. But then I noticed something else. I live in an apartment complex with a piped gas network, and I noticed my bills were rising too. In fact, PNG (Piped Natural Gas) prices have soared by nearly 100% in the past year. So what’s going on here, you ask? Well, some of it has to do with Russia. The country is the largest energy exporter in the world. But after the Ukraine invasion, Russia became a pariah of sorts. Many countries decided to isolate Moscow and Europeans in particular began scaling back their gas imports quite quickly. Naturally, they had to source gas from elsewhere. And they turned to the Middle East. But gas producers here couldn’t crank up production overnight, which gave way to a demand-supply mismatch. This mismatch in turn pushed gas prices higher. And here we are. Now there is a caveat here — India meets 50% of its demand through domestic production. This comes from state-owned gas fields. But domestic prices in India are regulated since most Indians depend on gas, one way or another. So in a bid to make gas accessible to most people, the government keeps a lid on prices. And every 6 months, they revise the price of domestically-produced natural gas. It looks at the global rates, does some calculations of its own and says, “Okay, here is the Administered Price Mechanism (APM) rate for gas”. But, there’s only so much the government can do with prices. If they keep domestic prices too low, it doesn’t incentivize producers to invest in the future, especially if they don’t have any semblance of parity with global producers. So despite keeping a lid on prices, the government still often revises the APM upwards when global prices shoot up. For instance, it increased the prices by a whopping 110% on 31 March. And another 40% on 1st October. This took gas prices to record highs in India! Now, domestic gas producers (ONGC etc) absolutely love it. The higher prices pad their coffers quite nicely. But the protagonists of our story, the City Gas Distributors (CGDs) — the likes of Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas don’t enjoy this quite as much. These entities buy gas from Oil Marketing companies and deliver it to homes and fuel stations. And they can’t always pass the price hike to consumers. Why? you ask. Well, it hurts their volumes. They’re competing with other sources of fuel and when the gap between the prices of petrol and CNG dissipates, it becomes harder to sell gas. So they are wary of increasing prices willy-nilly. And they may often take the hit themselves, just to keep volumes high. But their problem isn’t just limited to the price hikes. See, back in 2014, the government changed its gas allocation policy. It prioritized companies involved in CNG and PNG distribution. So in some ways, the subsidised APM gas first went to gas distributors. But in the past few years, domestic APM gas production has been on a decline and it has simply not kept pace with the growing demand. So despite being on the priority list, they’re still having to rely on more expensive, imported international gas to meet demand. And this hurts their margin even more. It’s no wonder then that their stock prices have slumped by nearly 30% in the past year. This brings us to the final question — what’s next for gas companies? Well, the government has been trying to address some of these issues. It has recently increased the APM gas allocation to city gas distributors — from 85% to 94%. So the likes of Mahanagar Gas can source more price-controlled gas Also, since May 2022, they’ve handed over a mandate to the Gas Authority of India Ltd (Ltd) to source gas from ‘domestic difficult fields’ i.e the deepsea ones. Now bear in mind, this gas will be priced at a premium over APM gas, but the government can exercise some degree of price control since it’s still domestically produced gas. This could replace some of the higher-priced imports that City Gas Distributors have been relying on so far. But wait — Isn’t this a temporary fix? If the country isn’t producing as much cheap gas, then we should have alternatives in place no? Well yes. We are exploring new gas fields in India. Reliance is currently cranking out gas from Asia’s deepest gas field called the KG D6 block along the Bay of Bengal. And as a company, they expect to meet 15% of India’s gas demand by 2023. Gas distributors could also lock themselves into long-term contracts with private gas fields in India or even global producers. This could give them some clarity on pricing. Finally, you have to remember that these companies are virtual monopolies. Take Mahanagar Gas for instance — They say they’re the sole authorized distributor of CNG and PNG in Mumbai. Yes, this exclusivity period will end soon. But they’ll still own the infrastructure. They build the piped networks and it isn’t easy to replicate this. So even if other distributors join the fray, the likes of Mahanagar will always be able to command a license fee from these late movers. And if you think about it, CNGs and PNGs aren’t going anywhere. The government wants to double the share of natural gas in India’s energy basket — from 6.7% today to 15% by 2030. And the demand is already robust. According to HDFC Securities, PNG connections have risen 21% annually during the last 5 years. CNG fuel stations have jumped 29% each year. So yeah, they’re in a tough spot right now, but the natural gas scene in India has only just begun playing out. Will the traditional city gas distributors dominate the future? Or will their fortunes continue to tumble? You let us know. Until then… Don't forget to share this Finshots on Twitter and WhatsApp. Ditto Insights: Why Millennials should buy a term plan According to a survey, only 17% of Indian millennials (25–35 yrs) have bought term insurance. The actual numbers are likely even lower. And the more worrying fact is that 55% hadn’t even heard of term insurance! So why is this happening? One common misconception is the dependent conundrum. Most millennials we spoke to want to buy a term policy because they want to cover their spouse and kids. And this makes perfect sense. After all, in your absence you want your term policy to pay out a large sum of money to cover your family’s needs for the future. But these very same people don’t think of their parents as dependents even though they support them extensively. I remember the moment it hit me. I routinely send money back home, but I had never considered my parents as my dependents. And when a colleague spoke about his experience, I immediately put two and two together. They were dependent on my income and my absence would most certainly affect them financially. So a term plan was a no-brainer for me. There’s another reason why millennials should probably consider looking at a term plan — Debt. Most people we spoke to have home loans, education loans and other personal loans with a considerable interest burden. In their absence, this burden would shift to their dependents. It’s not something most people think of, but it happens all the time. Finally, you actually get a pretty good bargain on term insurance prices when you’re younger. The idea is to pay a nominal sum every year (something that won’t burn your pocket) to protect your dependents in the event of your untimely demise. And this fee is the lowest when you’re young. So if you’re a millennial and you’re reading this, maybe you should reconsider buying a term plan. And don’t forget to talk to us at Ditto while you’re at it. 1.

But domestic prices in India are regulated since most Indians depend on gas, one way or another. So in a bid to make gas accessible to most people, the government keeps a lid on prices. And every 6 months, they revise the price of domestically-produced natural gas. It looks at the global rates, does some calculations of its own and says, “Okay, here is the Administered Price Mechanism (APM) rate for gas”. But, there’s only so much the government can do with prices. If they keep domestic prices too low, it doesn’t incentivize producers to invest in the future, especially if they don’t have any semblance of parity with global producers. So despite keeping a lid on prices, the government still often revises the APM upwards when global prices shoot up. For instance, it increased the prices by a whopping 110% on 31 March. And another 40% on 1st October. This took gas prices to record highs in India! Now, domestic gas producers (ONGC etc) absolutely love it. The higher prices pad their coffers quite nicely. But the protagonists of our story, the City Gas Distributors (CGDs) — the likes of Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas don’t enjoy this quite as much. These entities buy gas from Oil Marketing companies and deliver it to homes and fuel stations. And they can’t always pass the price hike to consumers. Why? you ask. Well, it hurts their volumes. They’re competing with other sources of fuel and when the gap between the prices of petrol and CNG dissipates, it becomes harder to sell gas. So they are wary of increasing prices willy-nilly. And they may often take the hit themselves, just to keep volumes high. But their problem isn’t just limited to the price hikes. See, back in 2014, the government changed its gas allocation policy. It prioritized companies involved in CNG and PNG distribution. So in some ways, the subsidised APM gas first went to gas distributors. But in the past few years, domestic APM gas production has been on a decline and it has simply not kept pace with the growing demand. So despite being on the priority list, they’re still having to rely on more expensive, imported international gas to meet demand. And this hurts their margin even more. It’s no wonder then that their stock prices have slumped by nearly 30% in the past year. This brings us to the final question — what’s next for gas companies? Well, the government has been trying to address some of these issues. It has recently increased the APM gas allocation to city gas distributors — from 85% to 94%. So the likes of Mahanagar Gas can source more price-controlled gas Also, since May 2022, they’ve handed over a mandate to the Gas Authority of India Ltd (Ltd) to source gas from ‘domestic difficult fields’ i.e the deepsea ones. Now bear in mind, this gas will be priced at a premium over APM gas, but the government can exercise some degree of price control since it’s still domestically produced gas. This could replace some of the higher-priced imports that City Gas Distributors have been relying on so far. But wait — Isn’t this a temporary fix? If the country isn’t producing as much cheap gas, then we should have alternatives in place no? Well yes. We are exploring new gas fields in India. Reliance is currently cranking out gas from Asia’s deepest gas field called the KG D6 block along the Bay of Bengal. And as a company, they expect to meet 15% of India’s gas demand by 2023. Gas distributors could also lock themselves into long-term contracts with private gas fields in India or even global producers. This could give them some clarity on pricing. Finally, you have to remember that these companies are virtual monopolies. Take Mahanagar Gas for instance — They say they’re the sole authorized distributor of CNG and PNG in Mumbai. Yes, this exclusivity period will end soon. But they’ll still own the infrastructure. They build the piped networks and it isn’t easy to replicate this. So even if other distributors join the fray, the likes of Mahanagar will always be able to command a license fee from these late movers. And if you think about it, CNGs and PNGs aren’t going anywhere. The government wants to double the share of natural gas in India’s energy basket — from 6.7% today to 15% by 2030. And the demand is already robust. According to HDFC Securities, PNG connections have risen 21% annually during the last 5 years. CNG fuel stations have jumped 29% each year. So yeah, they’re in a tough spot right now, but the natural gas scene in India has only just begun playing out. Will the traditional city gas distributors dominate the future? Or will their fortunes continue to tumble? You let us know. Until then… Don't forget to share this Finshots on Twitter and WhatsApp. Ditto Insights: Why Millennials should buy a term plan According to a survey, only 17% of Indian millennials (25–35 yrs) have bought term insurance. The actual numbers are likely even lower. And the more worrying fact is that 55% hadn’t even heard of term insurance! So why is this happening? One common misconception is the dependent conundrum. Most millennials we spoke to want to buy a term policy because they want to cover their spouse and kids. And this makes perfect sense. After all, in your absence you want your term policy to pay out a large sum of money to cover your family’s needs for the future. But these very same people don’t think of their parents as dependents even though they support them extensively. I remember the moment it hit me. I routinely send money back home, but I had never considered my parents as my dependents. And when a colleague spoke about his experience, I immediately put two and two together. They were dependent on my income and my absence would most certainly affect them financially. So a term plan was a no-brainer for me. There’s another reason why millennials should probably consider looking at a term plan — Debt. Most people we spoke to have home loans, education loans and other personal loans with a considerable interest burden. In their absence, this burden would shift to their dependents. It’s not something most people think of, but it happens all the time. Finally, you actually get a pretty good bargain on term insurance prices when you’re younger. The idea is to pay a nominal sum every year (something that won’t burn your pocket) to protect your dependents in the event of your untimely demise. And this fee is the lowest when you’re young. So if you’re a millennial and you’re reading this, maybe you should reconsider buying a term plan. And don’t forget to talk to us at Ditto while you’re at it. 1.
